The MegaMorph version of FERENGI.

*FERENGI: Full and Efficient Redshifting of Ensembles of Nearby Galaxy Images*

See [here](http://www.mpia-hd.mpg.de/FERENGI/) for details of the original version, described in this paper:
[Barden, Jahnke & Häußler, 2008, ApJS, 175, 105](http://esoads.eso.org/abs/2008ApJS..175..105B).

The MegaMorph project (specifically Bamford, Häußler and Vika) has added a few options to FERENGI, and
ensured that it works correctly for redshifting low-redshift SDSS to how they would appear at slightly higher redshift,
but still observed by the SDSS survey.

This code is used in the paper:
[Vika et al., 2013, MNRAS, 435, 623](http://esoads.eso.org/abs/2013MNRAS.435..623V).
